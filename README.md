#### Distributed Kafka Producer

This is an attempt of creating a distributed Kafka producer.

The goal of this project is to orchestrate a set of producers running on different
machines in order to send video files into a Kafka cluster thus testing the cluster.

This project is at very early stages thus this README file will be updated only when it
becomes available for testing.
